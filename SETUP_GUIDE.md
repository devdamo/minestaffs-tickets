## 📋 Role Giver Configuration

Here's how the role giver system works in your config:

        {
            "id": "approve_membership",
            "name": "✅ Approve Membership",
            "color": "green",
            "roleId": "1230238352326791320",
            "emoji": "✅",
            "disableAfterUse": true
        }
    ]
}
```

### Configuration Options:
- **`id`**: Unique identifier for the role giver
- **`name`**: Button text displayed to users
- **`color`**: Button color (`green`, `red`, `blue`, `gray`)
- **`roleId`**: The Discord role ID to grant
- **`emoji`**: Button emoji (optional)

### Adding More Role Givers:
You can add multiple role giver buttons to any ticket type:
```json
"roleGivers": [
    {
        "id": "approve_basic",
        "name": "✅ Basic Member",
        "color": "green", 
        "roleId": "ROLE_ID_HERE"
    },
    {
        "id": "approve_premium",
        "name": "⭐ Premium Member",
        "color": "blue",
        "roleId": "ANOTHER_ROLE_ID_HERE" 
    }
]
```
